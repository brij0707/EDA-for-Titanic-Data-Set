# **1. Introduction to Dataset**
---

- One of the most **popular disasters** in the history is the **sinking** of the **Titanic**.

- **Titanic** was a British passenger ship operated by the **White Star Line** that **sank** in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912.

- The reason behind **sinking** of this beast was because of **striking** to an **iceberg** while travelling from **Southampton** to **New York City**.
- The popular event has **inspired** numerous **works of art**, the most prominient being the 1997 movie - Titanic. Don't tell me that you have not watched it yet.

# **2. Problem Statement**
---

- On **April 15, 1912** the **Titanic** **sank**, costing the lives of **1502 out of 2224** passengers and crew.

- Unfortunately, there **werenâ€™t enough lifeboats** for everyone onboard, causing a **disproportionate** number of **deaths**.

- While there was some element of **luck** involved in surviving, it seems some **groups of people** were more likely to **survive** than others.
- So, the primary objectives are to:

  -	Do a statistical analysis of **how** some group of **people** were **survived** more than others.

  - Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis of titanic dataset with **visualizations** and **storytelling**.
