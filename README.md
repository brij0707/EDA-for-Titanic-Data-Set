# **2. Problem Statement**
---

- On **April 15, 1912** the **Titanic** **sank**, costing the lives of **1502 out of 2224** passengers and crew.

- Unfortunately, there **werenâ€™t enough lifeboats** for everyone onboard, causing a **disproportionate** number of **deaths**.

- While there was some element of **luck** involved in surviving, it seems some **groups of people** were more likely to **survive** than others.
