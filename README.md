# **1. Introduction to Dataset**
---

- One of the most **popular disasters** in the history is the **sinking** of the **Titanic**.

- **Titanic** was a British passenger ship operated by the **White Star Line** that **sank** in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912.

- The reason behind **sinking** of this beast was because of **striking** to an **iceberg** while travelling from **Southampton** to **New York City**.
- The popular event has **inspired** numerous **works of art**, the most prominient being the 1997 movie - Titanic. Don't tell me that you have not watched it yet.

# **2. Problem Statement**
---

- On **April 15, 1912** the **Titanic** **sank**, costing the lives of **1502 out of 2224** passengers and crew.

- Unfortunately, there **werenâ€™t enough lifeboats** for everyone onboard, causing a **disproportionate** number of **deaths**.

- While there was some element of **luck** involved in surviving, it seems some **groups of people** were more likely to **survive** than others.
- So, the primary objectives are to:

  -	Do a statistical analysis of **how** some group of **people** were **survived** more than others.

  - Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis of titanic dataset with **visualizations** and **storytelling**.

# **3. Installing and Importing Libraries**
---
```python
!pip install -q datascience          # A package that is required by pandas-profiling library
!pip install -q pandas-profiling

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import pandas as pd                                                 # Importing for panel data analysis
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport                          # Importing Pandas Profiling (To generate Univariate Analysis) 
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)                          # Unfolding hidden features if the cardinality is high      
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)                         # Unfolding the max feature width for better clearity      
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)                             # Unfolding hidden data points if the cardinality is high
pd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', None)                      # Removing restriction over chained assignments operations
pd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.5f' % x)         # To suppress scientific notation over exponential values
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import numpy as np                                                  # Importing package numpys (For Numerical Python)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

import seaborn as sns                                               # Importing seaborn library for interactive visualization
%matplotlib inline
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import warnings                                                     # Importing warning to disable runtime warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")                                   # Warnings will appear only once
